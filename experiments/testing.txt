25/07/2025, 2:13â€¯pm - Ashutosh Kumar Jha: Hey. Sorry for replying lately. Actually I was travelling for 2 days and reached the college yesterday and took time for settling and all. Today was my registration for the upcoming semester and therefore most of the time went into it. Before some days, I was engaged into some personal problems related to medical issues and all and therefore was inactive and before that my full time (8 hr) internship started so I was not able to get time and took time to make things settled and stable and adapt to everything. Due to the above mentioned issues, I was unable to communicate with you and the team properly, able to attend meetings, etc. But now the things have become a little stable. I hope you can understand. 

For the sake of understanding the work done and will be done in the future, can you please provide me the following information: 

1. Work done till now 
2. Will be done in the upcoming days 
3. People we have in the backend team because mostly I will be working on the backend system (and I guess you too have the same position)
4. Any other information which you would like to provide. <This message was edited>
25/07/2025, 2:16â€¯pm - Ashutosh Kumar Jha: Regarding that, firstly I would like to state that I was unable to do so due to the issues mentioned above. I hope you can understand the pressure which I was having due to which I was unable to be active. Secondly,  I would like to ask about the alternatives for this if you can please provide.

10/08/2025, 2:40â€¯pm - Ashutosh Kumar Jha: Hey Chirag. 
I hope you are fine. As you can see, I am unable to attend the meetings since some last few days. Due to the high academic load, preparation for internships and placements, some side hustles and other stuff, I am unable to give time to the scheduled meetings, plus I have been unhealthy since the last few days. I want to ask you if there is right now some work which I can do in the site, so that I can push my changes and you can merge those changes and the work could proceed further. Thanks for your time and consideration.
